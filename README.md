Hello there! My name is Alexey Onyshchenko. I'm a QA Enginner at Waverley Software. I have more than 7 years experience in Quality Assurance. 
I'm willing to learn Automated Testing because, from my point of view, nowadays a modern QA specialist should be "universal" and shall be able to conduct a wide set of tasks e.g. API testing, Automated testing, working with CI/CD, Security testing etc, but not only manual testing.
Another reason - project needs. I need to actualize and extend my "knowledge" of automated testing since a QA manual team will be participated in the automated testing activities (writing automated tests).
