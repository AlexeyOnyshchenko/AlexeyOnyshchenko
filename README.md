Hello there! My name is Alexey Onyshchenko. I'm a QA Enginner at Waverley Software. I have more than 7 years experience in Quality Assurance. 
I'm willing to learn Automated Testing because, from my point of view, nowadays a modern QA specialist should be "universal" and shall be able to conduct a wide set of tasks e.g. API testing, Automated testing, working with CI/CD, Security testing etc, but not only manual testing.
Another reason - project needs. Currently, a customer is actively considering what tool(s) will be used for the automated testing accross the projects and seems like a current QA manual team will participate in the Automated testing activities (writing automated tests). Because of that it would be very helpful for me to actualize and extend my "knowledge" of automated testing.
